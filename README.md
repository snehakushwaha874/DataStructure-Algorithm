# 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms Repository
Welcome to my **DSA Repository** — a comprehensive collection of all the **Data Structures and Algorithms** problems I've solved and studied while preparing for coding interviews, competitive programming, and technical rounds. This repository is aimed at building a strong foundation in DSA with clean, optimized, and well-commented code.


## ✅ Topics Covered
- ✅ Arrays & 2D Arrays  
- ✅ Strings  
- ✅ Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)  
- ✅ Stacks & Queues  
- ✅ Trees (Binary, Binary Search Trees, Traversals)  
- ✅ Graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Union-Find)  
- ✅ Recursion & Backtracking  
- ✅ Searching & Sorting Algorithms  
- ✅ Dynamic Programming  
- ✅ Bit Manipulation  
- ✅ Sliding Window / Two Pointer Technique  
- ✅ Hashing & Prefix Sums  
- ✅ Greedy Algorithms  
- ✅ Miscellaneous Logic Building Questions


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- 💻 Language: `C++` (primarily)
- ⚙️ IDE: `Visual Studio Code` / `Code::Blocks`
- 📚 Concepts: Focused on problem-solving, complexity analysis & STL
- 📘 Occasionally includes Python for certain problems
